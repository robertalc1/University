Behind the Scenes
The project is structured around four core classes:

Locality: This abstract base class defines the common properties and behaviors for all locality types.
City: A subclass representing city records with their specific attributes.
Village: A subclass dedicated to village records and their unique characteristics.
LocalityManager: The main class responsible for managing the graphical user interface (GUI) and overseeing CRUD operations on localities.
With this application, managing localities becomes a seamless process, combining simplicity, efficiency, and reliability.
